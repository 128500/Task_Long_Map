# A short explanation about doing this task.

My implementation of LongMap interface isn't the good one (and simple PerfomanceMeasuringMainClass is an evidence of it) and based on a simple unsorted array.
But if it was based on hash and buckets and LinkedList (like it is in HashMap), one might say that it was just 'copy-paste'.
I tried to make something my, not simply "I copy it here and paste it here". 
I think the main aim (to show my codestyle/teststyle) was achieved: code and tests are on the plate.

# long-map

Finish development of class LongMapImpl, which implements a map with keys of type long. It should work similar to HashMap. Requirements:
* it should not use any known Map implementations; 
* it should use as less memory as possible and have adequate performance;
* the main aim is to see your codestyle and teststyle
